futile if I don't utilize what I do though\r\n[03:20.30]For good at least once in a while\r\n[03:21.58]So I wanna make sure somewhere in this chicken scratch I scribble and doodle\r\n[03:24.11]Enough rhymes to maybe to try and help get some people through tough times\r\n[03:27.15]But I gotta keep a few punchlines just in case 'cause even you unsigned\r\n[03:30.24]Rappers are hungry looking at me like it's lunchtime\r\n[03:32.88]I know there was a time where once I\r\n[03:34.25]Was king of the underground, but I still rap like I'm on my Pharoahe Monch grind\r\n[03:37.72]So I crunch rhymes, but sometimes when you combine\r\n[03:39.91]Appeal with the skin color of mine\r\n[03:41.50]You get too big and here they come trying to\r\n[03:43.65]Censor you like that one line I said on \"I'm Back\" from the Mathers LP\r\n[03:46.93]One when I tried to say \"I'll take seven kids from Columbine\r\n[03:49.57]Put 'em all in a line, add an AK-47, a revolver and a nine\"\r\n[03:53.07]See if I get away

know what the fuck that you rhyme for\r\n[04:03.79]You're pointless as Rapunzel with fucking cornrows\r\n[04:06.14]You write normal, fuck being normal\r\n[04:08.36]And I just bought a new Raygun from the future\r\n[04:10.19]Just to come and shoot ya like when Fabolous made Ray J mad\r\n[04:12.67]'Cause Fab said he looked like a fag at Maywhether's pad\r\n[04:14.47]Singin' to a man while they played piano\r\n[04:16.02]Man, oh man, that was a 24/7 special on the cable channel\r\n[04:19.20]So Ray J went straight to the radio station the very next day\r\n[04:21.96]\"Hey, Fab, I'mma kill

demonstrating\r\n[04:33.76]How to give a motherfuckin' audience a feeling like it's levitating\r\n[04:35.33]Never fading, and I know that the haters are forever waiting\r\n[04:37.18]For the day that they can say I fell off, they'd be celebrating\r\n[04:38.78]'Cause I know the way to get 'em motivated\r\n[04:40.07]I make elevating music, you make elevator music\r\n[04:41.81]Oh, he's too

occurs to you\r\n[04:56.13]While I'm ripping any one of these verses diverse as you\r\n[04:58.04]It's curtains, I'm inadvertently hurtin' you\r\n[04:59.78]How many verses I gotta murder to\r\n[05:01.42]Prove that if you were half as nice, your songs you can sacrifice virgins too uh!\r\n[05:04.90]School flunkie, pill junky\r\n[05:06.85]But look at the accolades the skills brung me\r\n[05:09.35]Full of myself, but still hungry\r\n[05:11.17]I bully myself 'cause I make me do what I put my mind to\r\n[05:14.23]And I'm a million leagues above you, ill when I speak in tongues\r\n[05:17.75]But it's still tongue in cheek, fuck you\r\n[05:19.43]I'm drunk so Satan take the fucking wheel, I'm asleep in the front seat\r\n[05:22.87]Bumping Heavy D and the Boys, still chunky, but funky\r\n[05:25.77]But in my head there's something I can feel tugging and struggling\r\n[05:29.09]Angels fight with devils and, here's what they want from me\r\n[05:32.37]They asking me to eliminate some of the women hate\r\n[05:34.84]But if you take into consideration the bitter hatred I have\r\n[05:37.11]Then you may be a little patient and more sympathetic to the situation\r\n[05:39.65]And understand the discrimination\r\n[05:40.67]But fuck it, life's handing you lemons, make lemonade then\r\n[05:44.36]But if I can't batter the women how the fuck am I supposed to bake them a cake then?\r\n[05:47.87]Don't mistake it for Satan\r\n[05:49.36]It's a fatal mistake if you think I need to be overseas\r\n[05:51.35]And take a vacation to trip a broad\r\n[05:53.55]And

is music hoe\r\nI stopped chasing every chick under the sun many moons ago\r\nSo pretend my dick is a balloon and blow\r\n'Cause you better put a fork in it if you think I'mma lay here just spooning yo\r\nOh you think you the shit 'cause I just said you was beautiful\r\nDiabolical, till the last molecule, down to my last hair follicle and cuticle\r\nRotten to the core, to the bunghole all the way down\r\nTo my soul from my head to my toe\r\nEver since I was thirteen I learn how to sew, and sewed shut my own booty hole\r\nCause I ain't took no shit since I looked down to my nuts and saw my first pubic grow\r\nI told these stupid hoes when I come back I'mma set this bitch on fire\r\nAnd this time I don't mean I'mma pour gasoline on some chick and light her\r\n'Cause this time when I fuck

smothered in peanut butter putting on a tube of ya eye shadow and man it look nice\r\nYou should have seen it mother\r\nI think I'll put a piece of art on my visa card\r\nThen I'll go meet Mischa Barton with a Cuisinart\r\nThen mosy on over to Rosie O'Donnell's\r\nWith McDonald's jump on her lap and watch the Sopranos\r\n\r\n[Chorus]\r\n\r\nShady what are you doing chewing on a human\r\nGrab an aluminum bat hit Heidi Klum in the back boom\r\nAssuming the fact that dudes in the back room\r\nUsing the bathroom vacuum and a raccoon\r\nSkewing a rat or cat screwing a baboon\r\nYou shouldn't ask what is he doing with that broom\r\nYou should be glad he didn't leave you full of stab wounds\r\nYou in a trance I'm back doing my dance ooh\r\nBut there afraid I might get Sarah Palin by the hair\r\nAnd make her wear a bathing suit and take her para sailing\r\nShady why you gotta pick on the lady for\r\nWhy you make her read eighty four bedtime stories to you in baby talk?\r\nCos I'm

it\r\n[01:03.70]It was crazy, this shit went way beyond some Jay Z and Nas shit\r\n[01:06.90]And even though the battle was won, I feel like we lost it\r\n[01:09.48]I spent so much energy on it, honestly I'm exhausted\r\n[01:12.30]I'm so caught it I almost feel like I'm the one who caused it\r\n[01:15.61]This ain't what I'm in Hip Hop for, it's not why I got in it\r\n[01:18.50]That was never my object for someone to get killed\r\n[01:21.50]Why would I want to destroy something I helped build\r\n[01:24.50]It wasn't my intentions, my intentions were good\r\n[01:27.35]I went through my whole career with out ever mentioning\r\n[01:30.25]And that's just outta respect, for not running my mouth\r\n[01:33.14]And talking about something that I knew nothing about\r\n[01:36.00]Plus Dre told me stay out, just wasn't my beef, So I did\r\n[01:39.66]I just fell back, watched and gritted my teeth while he's all over TV\r\n[01:43.43]Now I'm talking a man who literally saved my life, like fuck

once you put someone's kids in it\r\n[02:25.80]Shit gets escalated, it ain't just words no more, is it\r\n[02:28.70]It's a different ball game, call names and you ain't just rapping\r\n[02:32.10]We actually tried to stop the 50 and Ja beef from happening\r\n[02:34.83]Me and Dre had sat with him, kicked it and had a chat with him\r\n[02:37.55]And asked him not to start it, he wasn't gonna go after him\r\n[02:40.60]Until Ja' start yappin' in magazines how he stabbed him\r\n[02:43.62]Fuck 'em 50, smash him, mash him, and let him have it\r\n[02:46.49]Meanwhile my intentions pulled me in

resurrection\r\n[02:55.20]Tries to blow the dust of his mic and make a new record\r\n[02:58.24]But now he's fucked the game up cause one of the ways I came up\r\n[03:00.68]Was through that publication, the same one that made me famous\r\n[03:03.80]Now the owner of it got a grudge against me for nothing but fuck it\r\n[03:06.90]That motherfucker can get it too, fuck 'em then\r\n[03:10.00]But I'm so busy being pissed off, I don't stop to think\r\n[03:12.80]That we just inherited 50's beef with Murder Inc\r\n[03:15.73]And he's inherited mine, which is fine, ain't like either of us mind\r\n[03:19.28]We still have soldiers that's on the front line that's willing to die for us\r\n[03:22.88]As soon as we give the orders, never to extort us\r\n[03:26.00]Strictly to show they support us\r\n[03:27.80]Maybe shout 'em out in a rap or up in a chorus to show we love 'em back\r\n[03:31.72]And to let 'em know how important it is to have Runyon Avenue soldiers up in our corners\r\n[03:36.31]Their loyalty to us is worth more then any award is\r\n[03:39.24]But I ain't trying to have none of my people hurt or murdered\r\n[03:42.00]It ain't worth it, I can't think of a perfecter way to word it\r\n[03:44.80]Then to just say that I love y'all too much to see the verdict\r\n[03:47.92]I'll walk away from it all before I'll let it go any further\r\n[03:51.01]But don't get it twisted, it's not a plea that I'm coping\r\n[03:53.80]I'm just willing to be the bigger man\r\n[03:55.80]If y'all can quit popping off at the jaws with the knocking\r\n[03:58.32]'Cause frankly

work, you and mama had to leave me\r\n[02:46.68]Then you started seein' daddy on the TV and mama didn't like it\r\n[02:50.39]And you and Lainie were to young to understand it\r\n[02:52.73]Papa was a
